    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Chicken Tikka</strong> is a classic, moghul dish where chicken is marinated in a spicy yogurt sauce and cooked on skewers. When chicken tikka is added to a creamy tomato sauce it is called <em>chicken tikka masala</em>. Masala literally means “spice” in Hindi, but describing dish as a masala often refers to having a spiced gravy.  </p>
